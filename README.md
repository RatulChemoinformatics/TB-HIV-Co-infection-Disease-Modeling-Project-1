Description:Â We have performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using a novel multidimensional graph-based clustering approach to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TB/HIV coinfection. Our methodology revealed key pathways linked to infectious and autoimmune diseases, immune responses, cardiovascular dysfunction, and metabolic processes. We identified therapeutic biomarkers influenced by known therapeutic chemicals and developed robust machine learning-based QSAR models to identify potential drug candidates, including S5105 proanthocyanidin, a modulator of key inflammatory biomarkers TNF, IL1B, and IFNG. Additionally, we examined the impact of environmental toxicants like arsenic, air pollutants, and carbon monoxide, which contribute to immune dysregulation, lung fibrosis, and inflammatory responses in coinfected individuals. Our models also demonstrated that poor air quality, specifically PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, correlates with increased TB/HIV coinfection rates, highlighting the importance of air quality in disease progression and monitoring.
